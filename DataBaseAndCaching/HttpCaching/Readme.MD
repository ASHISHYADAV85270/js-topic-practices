# 🚀 Static vs Dynamic Caching

> Make your applications load faster and scale better using caching techniques.

## 🟣 Static Caching ![Static](https://img.shields.io/badge/type-static-blue)

Static caching is used for files that rarely change, such as:

- 🖼️ Images
- 🎨 CSS files
- ⚙️ JavaScript files
- 🔤 Fonts

### ✅ How Static Caching Works:

- **Browser Caching**  
  Static content is automatically cached by browsers using headers like `Cache-Control`, `Expires`, and `ETag`.  
  This reduces repeated network requests and speeds up load time.

- **Server/CDN Caching**  
  Static assets are cached by CDNs (Cloudflare, CloudFront, etc.) or reverse proxies (NGINX, Varnish) to deliver them faster without contacting the backend.

## 🟠 Dynamic Caching ![Dynamic](https://img.shields.io/badge/type-dynamic-yellow)

Dynamic caching is used for content that changes frequently:

- 💬 API responses
- 📝 Dynamic HTML Pages
- 👥 Personalized data

### ✅ How Dynamic Caching Works:

- **Server-side Caching**  
  Servers cache dynamic responses temporarily using Redis, Memcached, CDN Edge Caching, etc.  
  This improves response time and reduces load on databases or backend APIs.

- **Browser-side Caching**  
  ⚠️ By default, browsers avoid caching dynamic content unless you explicitly allow it using headers like `Cache-Control` or `ETag`.  
  APIs usually disable browser caching to avoid stale or outdated data being served.

## 📊 Static vs Dynamic Caching — Comparison

| Feature | Static Caching | Dynamic Caching |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Typical Content | Images, CSS, JS, Fonts | API Responses, Dynamic HTML |
| Browser Caching | ✅ Common | ⚠️ Rare (needs explicit headers) |
| Server/CDN Caching | ✅ Common | ✅ Common |
| Benefits | Reduces bandwidth, improves page speed | Reduces backend load, faster API responses |

## 🎯 Demo (Request Flow)

### ✅ First Visit
- User requests `style.css`  
    → Request goes to CDN/Server  
    → Response is cached by the browser.

### ✅ Second Visit
- User requests `style.css`  
    → Served directly from Browser Cache  
    → Instant Load.

### ✅ Dynamic API Example
- User requests `/api/user-info`  
    → Request goes to Server  
    → May be cached on the server  
    → Browser usually does **NOT** cache it unless explicitly instructed.

## 🛠️ Recommended Caching Tools

- Redis
- Memcached
- Varnish
- Cloudflare / CloudFront
- NGINX / Apache

## ✅ Notes

> 🟣 Static content is safe to cache on both Browser and Server/CDN.

> 🟠 Dynamic content is mainly cached on the Server/CDN. Use browser caching for dynamic APIs only if handled carefully.

> ⚠️ Choose your caching strategy based on content type and data freshness requirements.
